Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science
that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks
that normally require human intelligence.

These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving,
language understanding, and decision-making.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that allows systems
to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses
neural networks with many layers.
